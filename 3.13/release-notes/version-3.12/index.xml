ArangoSearch WAND optimization (Enterprise Edition) For arangosearch Views and inverted indexes (and by extension search-alias Views), you can define a list of sort expressions that you want to optimize. This is also known as WAND optimization.
If you query a View with the SEARCH operation in combination with a SORT and LIMIT operation, search results can be retrieved faster if the SORT expression matches one of the optimized expressions.</description></item><item><title>Known Issues in ArangoDB 3.12</title><link>http://localhost/3.13/release-notes/version-3.12/known-issues-in-3-12/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://localhost/3.13/release-notes/version-3.12/known-issues-in-3-12/</guid><description>Note that this page does not list all open issues.

The server immediately closes the connection if you attempt to use the VelocyStream protocol. If you specify any scheme starting with vst in the --server.endpoint startup option of a client tool, the HTTP protocol is used instead.
The following metrics related to VelocyStream have been removed:
arangodb_request_body_size_vst arangodb_vst_connections_total VelocyPack remains as ArangoDB&amp;rsquo;s binary storage format and you can continue to use it in transport over the HTTP protocol, as well as use JSON over the HTTP protocol.</description></item></channel></rss>
