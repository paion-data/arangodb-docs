The startup option has been renamed to --database.extended-names in 3.11 and now controls whether you want to use the extended naming constraints for database, collection, View, and index names.
The feature is disabled by default to ensure compatibility with existing client drivers and applications that only support ASCII names according to the traditional naming constraints used in previous ArangoDB versions.</description></item></channel></rss>
