The only difference to working with vertex documents is that the _from and _to attributes are mandatory and must contain document identifiers.
The Edge API is useful if you want to look up the inbound and outbound edges of a vertex with low overhead. You can also retrieve edges with AQL queries, but queries need to be parsed and planned, and thus have an overhead.</description></item></channel></rss>
