For additional information, see arangodb.com/community-server/&amp;nbsp;.
General Graph Database: Native support for storing and querying graphs comprised of vertices and edges. You can model complex domains because edges are documents without any restrictions in complexity.
Document Database: A modern document database system that allows you to model data intuitively and evolve the data model easily. Documents can be organized in collections, and collections in databases for multi-tenancy.</description></item><item><title>Enterprise Edition Features</title><link>http://localhost/3.10/about-arangodb/features/enterprise-edition/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://localhost/3.10/about-arangodb/features/enterprise-edition/</guid><description>The Enterprise Edition has all the features of the Community Edition and, on top of that, the features outlined below. For additional information, see arangodb.com/enterprise-server/&amp;nbsp;.
Performance SmartGraphs: Value-based sharding of large graph datasets for better data locality when traversing graphs.
EnterpriseGraphs: A specialized version of SmartGraphs, with an automatic sharding key selection.
SmartGraphs using SatelliteCollections: Collections replicated on all cluster nodes can be combined with graphs sharded by document attributes to enable more local execution of graph queries.</description></item><item><title>Highlights by Version</title><link>http://localhost/3.10/about-arangodb/features/highlights-by-version/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://localhost/3.10/about-arangodb/features/highlights-by-version/</guid><description>Version 3.10 All Editions
Native ARM Support: Packages for the ARM architecture are now available, including native support for Apple silicon.
Computed Values: Persistent document attributes that are generated when documents are created or modified, using an AQL expression.
Inverted indexes: A new, eventually consistent index type that can accelerate a broad range of queries, providing similar search capabilities as arangosearch Views, but defined per collection and simpler to use.</description></item></channel></rss>
