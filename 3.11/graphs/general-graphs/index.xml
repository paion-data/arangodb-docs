Edge Definitions An edge definition is always a directed relation of a graph. Each graph can have arbitrary many relations defined within the edge definitions array.
Initialize the List Create a list of edge definitions to construct a graph:
graph_module._edgeDefinitions(relation1, relation2, ..., relationN)
relation (object, optional): An object representing a definition of one relation in the graph The list of edge definitions of a graph can be managed by the graph module itself.</description></item><item><title>Graph Functions</title><link>http://localhost/3.11/graphs/general-graphs/functions/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://localhost/3.11/graphs/general-graphs/functions/</guid><description>This chapter describes various functions on a graph. A lot of these accept a vertex (or edge) example as parameter as defined in the next section.
Examples explain the API using the City Graph:
Definition of examples For many of the following functions examples can be passed in as a parameter. Examples are used to filter the result set for objects that match the conditions. These examples can have the following values:</description></item></channel></rss>
