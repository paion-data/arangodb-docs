This approach not only delivers performance as well as capacity improvements, but also achieves resilience by means of replication and automatic fail-over. Furthermore, you can build systems that scale their capacity dynamically up and down automatically according to demand.</description></item><item><title>Sharding</title><link>http://localhost/3.11/deploy/architecture/data-sharding/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://localhost/3.11/deploy/architecture/data-sharding/</guid><description>ArangoDB organizes its collection data in shards. Sharding allows to use multiple machines to run a cluster of ArangoDB instances that together constitute a single database system.
Sharding is used to distribute data across physical machines in an ArangoDB Cluster. It is a method to determine the optimal placement of documents on individual DB-Servers.
This enables you to store much more data, since ArangoDB distributes the data automatically to the different servers.</description></item><item><title>Replication</title><link>http://localhost/3.11/deploy/architecture/replication/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://localhost/3.11/deploy/architecture/replication/</guid><description>Replication allows you to replicate data onto another machine. It forms the base of all disaster recovery and failover features ArangoDB offers.
ArangoDB offers synchronous and asynchronous replication.
Synchronous replication is used between the DB-Servers of an ArangoDB Cluster.
Asynchronous replication is used:
between the Leader and the Follower of an ArangoDB Active Failover setup between multiple ArangoDB Data Centers (inside the same Data Center replication is synchronous) Synchronous replication Synchronous replication only works within an ArangoDB Cluster and is typically used for mission critical data which must be accessible at all times.</description></item></channel></rss>
