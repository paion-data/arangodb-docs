The single server as well as other deployment modes try to obtain a global write transaction lock to enforce consistency across all servers, databases, collections etc. Hot backups still require no Data Definition operations (e.g., create database, create collection) to be active at the time of hot backup, please review the requirements and limitations for more details.
Once that lock could be acquired the hot backup itself is most readily described as a consistent snapshot on the local file system.</description></item><item><title>_arangobackup_ Options</title><link>http://localhost/3.11/components/tools/arangobackup/options/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://localhost/3.11/components/tools/arangobackup/options/</guid><description>Usage: arangobackup &amp;lt;operation&amp;gt; [&amp;lt;options&amp;gt;]
